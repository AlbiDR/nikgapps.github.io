      <div id="nikgappsConfig" class="faq__item">
        <h4>What is nikgapps.config and how to use it?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            NikGapps.config is a configuration file which allows you to configure your installation the way you like.
            You can skip any Pacakge that you don't want to be part of your installation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Nikgapps.config is placed in <code>/sdcard/NikGApps</code> folder
            automatically after first install with all the packages enabled
            for installation.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you want to configure the installation with your very first
            installation, extract nikgapps.config from the gapps zip and place
            it to <code>/sdcard/NikGapps</code> folder.
          </li>
          <li>
            Edit the file and set 0,1,2 against the package that you want to configure,
            save the file, flash the gapps.
          </li>
          <li>
            NikGapps installer recognizes 3 config values <br>
            -> 0 (Skip the package) <br>
            -> 1 (install the package and delete corresponding aosp app) <br>
            -> 2 (install the package and <b style="color:red">do not</b> delete corresponding aosp app) <br>
          </li>
          <li>
            For e.g. if you want to skip GoogleContacts during the installation, the
            config should read <code>GoogleContacts=0</code>. <br>
            if you want to install GoogleContacts and remove Aosp Contacts, config should read
            <code>GoogleContacts=1</code>. <br>
            if you want to install GoogleContacts and keep Aosp Contacts, config should read
            <code>GoogleContacts=2</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            All the lines starting # in config file are comments. Adding
            comments (#) in front of Package name will not skip it's
            installation. i.e. <code># YouTube=0</code> will not skip the
            installation.
          </li>
          <li>
            'files' Package in nikgapps.config is not GoogleFiles. it is a
            package of set of important files for gapps installations. Never
            skip that
          </li>
        </ul>

      <div id="debloaterConfig" class="faq__item">
        <h4>How to use debloater.config?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Debloater config is a configuration that allows you to remove files/folders from system. You can place a
            file named debloater.config in <code>/sdcard/NikGapps</code> folder and add the folder name/file path that you want to remove and flash latest version of 
            <u><a style="color:blue" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/nikgapps/files/Releases/Debloater/">Debloater Zip</a></u>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Debloater recognizes the folder names that you
            want to delete in priv-app or app folder.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can Just enter the name of the folder you want
            to delete. For e.g. YouTube. This would remove the YouTube folder
            wherever it is located in <code>/system/app</code>,
            <code>/system/priv-app</code>, <code>/system/product/app</code>,
            <code>/system/product/priv-app</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you want to delete a specific file/folder you can enter full
            path. For e.g. <code>/system/app/YouTube</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            However, the above one wouldn't work in case of SAR device since the
            partition path you're looking for can be
            <code>/system_root/system/app/YouTube</code> or
            <code>/system/system/app/YouTube</code>(Hence use the Folder method).
          </li>

        <h4>The installation failed?</h4>
        <p>It could be because of sevaral reasons</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In case of <code>Busybox setup failed. Aborting...</code> error, Push the
            package to /sdcard and try flashing again.
          </li>
          <li>
            In case the zip is flashed but you don't see gapps in Rom, Check if you have kept the package in a folder
            with spaces in its name.
            Try pushing the
            package to <code>/sdcard</code> and try flashing again.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure the downloaded file is not corrupted.</li>
          <li>
            Make sure zip file opens properly in File Explorer.</li>
          <li>
            Try mounting system manually in recovery before flashing the zip
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are on <code>A/B</code> device, make sure you follow the
            procedure (Flash the rom, twrp, reboot to recovery, flash rom,
            twrp, reboot to recovery, flash gapps).

      <div class="faq__item">
        <h4>Is Addon Package compatible with Android 9 and 10 both?</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              No! Since android 9 and 10 differs in mounting mechanism, NikGapps follows the right standard based on
              android version you're installing the packages in.
            </li>
            <li>
              Flashing android 9 package in 10 and vice-versa will install the app normally. However, it won't work fine
              after dirty flash. It is recommended to flash appropriate package depending on android version.
