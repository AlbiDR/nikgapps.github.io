                What is NikGapps.config and how to use it?
            </div>

            <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        NikGapps.config is a configuration file which allows you to configure your installation the way
                        you
                        like.
                        You can skip any Package that you don't want to be part of your installation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        NikGapps.config is placed in <code>/sdcard/NikGapps</code> folder
                        automatically after first install with all the packages enabled
                        for installation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you want to configure the installation with your very first
                        installation, extract NikGapps.config from the gapps zip and place
                        it to <code>/sdcard/NikGapps</code> folder.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Edit the file and set 0,1,2 against the package that you want to configure,
                        save the file, flash the gapps.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        NikGapps installer recognizes 3 config values <br>
                        -> 0 (Skip the package) <br>
                        -> 1 (install the package and delete corresponding aosp app) <br>
                        -> 2 (install the package and <b style="color:red">do not</b> delete corresponding aosp app)
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For e.g. if you want to skip GoogleContacts during the installation, the
                        config should read <code>GoogleContacts=0</code>. <br>
                        if you want to install GoogleContacts and remove Aosp Contacts, config should read
                        <code>GoogleContacts=1</code>. <br>
                        if you want to install GoogleContacts and keep Aosp Contacts, config should read
                        <code>GoogleContacts=2</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All the lines starting # in config file are comments. Adding
                        comments (#) in front of Package name will not skip it's
                        installation. i.e. <code># YouTube=0</code> will not skip the
                        installation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        'ExtraFiles' Package in NikGapps.config is not GoogleFiles. it is a
                        package of set of important files for gapps installations. Never
                        skip that
                    </li>

                How to use debloater.config?
            </div>

            <div class="content">

                    <li>
                        Debloater config is a configuration that allows you to remove files/folders from system. You can
                        place a
                        file named debloater.config in <code>/sdcard/NikGapps</code> folder and add the folder name/file
                        path that you want to remove and flash latest version of
                        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/NikGapps/files/Releases/Debloater/">Debloater Zip</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Debloater recognizes the folder names that you
                        want to delete in priv-app or app folder.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can Just enter the name of the folder you want
                        to delete. For e.g. YouTube. This would remove the YouTube folder
                        wherever it is located in <code>/system/app</code>,
                        <code>/system/priv-app</code>, <code>/system/product/app</code>,
                        <code>/system/product/priv-app</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you want to delete a specific file/folder you can enter full
                        path. For e.g. <code>/system/app/YouTube</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        However, the above one wouldn't work in case of SAR device since the
                        partition path you're looking for can be
                        <code>/system_root/system/app/YouTube</code> or
                        <code>/system/system/app/YouTube</code>(Hence use the Folder method).

                        No! Since android 9 and 10 differs in mounting mechanism, NikGapps follows the right
                        standard
                        based on
                        android version you're installing the packages in.

                    <li>
                        Flashing android 9 package in 10 and vice-versa will install the app normally. However, it
                        won't
                        work fine
